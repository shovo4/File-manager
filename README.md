# FIle Manager App React.js
## Requirements:
### File Operations:
 - [x] When the user accesses for the first time, there will be a root folder. This folder cannot be copied, cut, or deleted, but it can be renamed.

 - [x] Users can create new files or folders in any folder. The newly created txt, js, ts, and json files should have valid initial content, which is not limited (e.g., the initial content of a txt file can be set as "test"). The content of other new files is empty.

 - [x] Users can delete files or folders.

 - [x] Users can rename files or folders.

 - [ ] Users can copy, cut, and paste files or folders.

 - [x] The state of folders and files created by the user will be restored upon their next visit.

 - [ ] Search feature with a search bar where users can search for files and folders by name.

### File Browsing:
 - [ ] Supports at least the following file types: txt, js, ts, json.
txt, js, ts, json, and other text files can be directly viewed on the right side of the browser. If there's syntax highlighting, it's even better.

 - [ ] Other files will not be displayed in the browser.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
